Title: Hierarchical Regularized Regression
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Garrett M. Weaver
Maintainer: Garrett M. Weaver <gmweaver@usc.edu>

Description: Fits hierarchical regularized regression models
    to incoporate potentially informative external data. Utilizes coordinate
    descent to efficiently fit regularized regression models both with and without
    external information with the most common penalties used in practice
    (i.e. ridge, lasso, elastic net). Support for standard R matrices, sparse
    matrices and big.matrix objects.
