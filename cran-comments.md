## Submission

This is a patch to fix the test errors generated on Solaris OS. 

* Checks reran on all other platforms as well

* The test errors were due to incorrect comparison solutions being generated by another R package on Solaris.
I now pre-generate comparison solutions and have removed the dependency on the other R package previously
used to generate the comparisons. The changes did not require any modifications to the src code.

* Removed glmnet from 'Suggests' in Description as package is no longer needed for tests. This allowed
for the minimum R version to be changed from 3.6 back down to 3.5 to accomodate the old release as well.
