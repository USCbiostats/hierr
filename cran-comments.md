## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added reference to paper describing methods in DESCRIPTION

* Removed the copy of GPL-2 license

* Added \value to any exported methods that were missing it in .Rd files

* Removed \dontrun from example in plot.tune_xrnet documentation

* Cleaned up error messages from stop("Error: ...") to stop("...")
