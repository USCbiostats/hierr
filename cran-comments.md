## Submission

This is a patch to fix the test errors generated on Solaris OS. 

* The test errors were due to incorrect comparison solutions being generated by another R package on Solaris.
I now pre-generate comparison solutions and have removed the dependency on the other R package previously
used to generate the comparisons. The changes did not require any modifications to the src code.
